This is the web app served up by the Disaster Radio firmware + the simulator web server.

# Dependencies

This web app uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for building. It requires Node.js 22 LTS. It is recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage your Node version.

If you have `nvm` installed:
```
nvm install 22
nvm use 22
```

# Setup

```
npm install
cp settings.js.example settings.js
```

# Building and running

```
npm run build  # build the js and css
npm start      # run the simulator server
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/ in a browser.

# Developing

```
npm run dev
```

This starts both the WebSocket simulator (port 8000) and the Vite dev server (port 5173) with hot reload. Open http://localhost:5173/ while developing.

# Websocket

The disaster.radio firmware opens up a websocket using [the ESPAsyncWebServer library](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer). Through this, client-side javascript can transmit and receive messages over the LoRa tranceiver. If you'd like to build an application for disaster.radio, you could write a websocket client that sends and receives messages in the same format. Currently, the firmware expects websocket messages in the following format:   
`<msgID><msgType>|<msg>`  
where,
* `<msgID>` is a two-byte binary unsigned integer representing an abitrary sequence number, this is sent back to the websocket client with an `!` appended to act as an acknowledgment and could be used for error-checking,  
* `<msgType>` is a single binary utf8 encoded character representing the application for which the message is intended, such 'c' for chat, 'm' for maps, or 'e' for events  
* `<msg>` is a binary utf8 encoded string of characters limited to 236 bytes, this can be treated as the body of the message and may be used to handle client-side concerns, such as intended recipient or requested map tile.    

An example messge may appear as follows,
`0100c|<noffle>@juul did you feel that earthquake!`

Alternatively, you could write another Layer3 client for as part of the disater radio firmware and create your own Layer 4 message format. See more about our networkng stack on our wiki, https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio/wiki/Layered-Model.

# Testing

## Running the tests

```
npm test
```

This runs the unit and integration tests once and exits — good for CI. To run in watch mode while developing:

```
npm run test:watch
```

To run the end-to-end tests:

```
npm run test:e2e
```

This automatically starts the WebSocket simulator and the Vite dev server, runs 12 browser tests with Playwright, then shuts them down. You do not need to start the dev server yourself first — if it's already running on port 5173, Playwright will reuse it (but the simulator on port 8000 must also be running in that case, or let Playwright start everything fresh).

Tests run automatically on GitHub Actions whenever files under `web/` change.

## Why these tests?

The web app runs inside a captive portal on an ESP32 with no internet access. That makes it hard to debug: you can't open DevTools on a phone connected to the node's WiFi, and every bug fix requires reflashing all the devices over USB. A test suite that catches regressions before flashing saves a lot of pain.

The app also has some subtle failure modes that are hard to spot by eye:
- The Vite production build minifies class names, so code that relies on `this.constructor.name` (like ashnazg's state key) silently breaks in the bundle but works fine in the dev server.
- The WebSocket protocol uses a binary 2-byte message ID for ACKs. If that lookup fails, sent messages never appear in the chat — no error, just silence.
- The `<script>` tag is in `<head>` without `defer`, so any DOM access before `DOMContentLoaded` throws.

These are the kinds of bugs that only show up on the real device, not in local dev. Tests that simulate the same conditions catch them before they get flashed.

## What the tests cover

### `src/test/e2e/chat.spec.js` — end-to-end browser tests (Playwright)

Tests the full experience in a real Chromium browser against the dev server simulator. This is the tier that catches bugs that only appear in the browser — DOM timing issues, CSS injection, form submission on mobile, and anything that requires the WebSocket to be live.

Covers:
- Page loads with correct title and dark background (CSS injected by bundle.js)
- Chat input and Send button are visible
- WebSocket connects and incoming messages from the simulator appear
- Joining: enter a name and press Enter or click Send → status message appears, input clears
- Chatting: send a message → appears as "self" with username, input clears
- Whitespace-only message shows an error placeholder without sending
- Route table: node count and MAC/signal bars render after simulator broadcasts a route table

### `src/test/route_message.test.js` — pure functions

`signalBars(metricHex)` and `formatMac(mac)` are pure functions with no side effects. Tests verify the signal strength thresholds (0x40/0x80/0xc0 boundaries) and that MAC addresses are formatted with colons. If the thresholds or formatting ever drift, these fail immediately.

### `socket.test.js` — WebSocket protocol

Tests the binary message format the firmware expects: a 2-byte little-endian sequence number prepended to every message, namespace+pipe+content for the body, and the ACK format (`[id0][id1]!`). Key things tested:

- The URL is built correctly from `window.location`
- Sent messages have the right binary layout
- ACKs are matched back to the right pending callback
- Listener callbacks are dispatched when a matching namespace arrives
- Short messages (< 3 bytes) are safely ignored
- Attempting to send when disconnected calls the callback with an error

### `chat_integration.test.js` — action layer with simulated app state

Tests the chat actions (`showMessage`, `join`, `showRoutes`, `sendMessage`) against a minimal fake `app` object with `state` and `changeState`. This is the layer most likely to break when the global state shape changes.

Specifically covers:
- `showMessage` appends to `app.state.chat.messages` with the right type
- Multiple messages accumulate (not overwrite)
- `showRoutes` parses the binary route table hex string into route objects with `mac`, `hops`, and `metric` fields
- The join flow: first message sets username, sends `~ <name> joined the channel` as a status message
- The chat flow: subsequent messages are formatted as `<name> message` and shown as type `"self"`
- Whitespace-only messages are rejected before sending
- Socket errors from the send callback are surfaced to the caller
